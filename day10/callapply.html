     <h1> CALL,APPLY,BIND</h1>   is Applicable to objects, they are used to call the functions.
        Their purpose is that, whenever we try to access the object properties with "this keyword" inside a function,
        then its gonna return undefined ,with the help of call,apply and bind i can get the required output.
        CALL, APPLY,BIND can also be used for passing additional arguments.
        The difference between CALL ,APPLY AND BIND is that in case of CALL additional arguments passed by separarting them 
        with comma operator.
        In case of APPLY , additional arguments passed inside an array.
        In case of BIND, return a function and while invoking that function 
        then can pass aditional arguments by separating them with comma operator.


        let obj={
            name:"sridhar",
            age:21
        }
        
        
        function printdata(weight,height)
        {
            console.log(this.name,this.age,height,weight);
        }
        
        
        printdata.call(obj,50,160);
        printdata.apply(obj,[60,160]);
        
        let newprintdata=printdata.bind(obj)
        
        newprintdata(70,170);


        <h1>PROTOTYPE:</h1>

        When ever we create a object it is always attached with a  Object prototype which has some hidden properities.
        Object prototype is like a parent through which objects or arrays or functions inherit the properities from.
        Thus ,in an array we can some array methods like map,reduce ,filter,which are array properities and these properities
        are inherited from Parent prototype


        let arr=[1,2,3];
          Object.prototype : PARENT prototype

        arr.__proto__ :returns me array properites

        arr.__proto__.__proto__: returns me Object.prototype Properites (hence we can say that arr array is inheriting the properites from Object.prototype)
